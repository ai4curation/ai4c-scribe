## Summary

This is a newly landed attempt review for uberon eval PR #627 against human PR #3511 /
issue #3003 (axiom_repair, medium). The scored metadiff is F1=0.400, precision=0.500,
recall=0.333. The agent changed 1 file(s) with +2/-2 diff lines:
src/ontology/uberon-edit.obo.

## Strengths

The diff has some overlap with the accepted PR, so the attempt likely found the relevant
neighborhood or part of the requested change. The patch is tightly scoped to one file.

## Issues

The attempt remains incomplete because it misses a substantial share of accepted
changes; it includes substantial extra or divergent changes.
